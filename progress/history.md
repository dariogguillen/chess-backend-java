# Session history

This is an append-only log of completed sessions, in chronological
order. Each entry corresponds to one feature being closed.

## Format

Each entry follows this shape:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <feature-id>

**Status:** done

**Summary:** One paragraph describing what was built, the approach
taken, and any notable decisions or trade-offs.

**Files touched:** comma-separated list, or a short bulleted list if
many files.

**Feature note:** `notes/NN-<feature-id>.md`.

## 2026-05-14 — health-check

**Status:** done

**Summary:** First vertical slice of the project. Added a dedicated
`GET /api/health` endpoint returning `{ status, version, timestamp }`
through a `@RestController` instead of routing through Actuator, so the
contract is owned by the application. The `version` comes from
`BuildProperties` (auto-registered after wiring the
`spring-boot-maven-plugin:build-info` execution into `pom.xml`), with a
fallback to `"unknown"` via `ObjectProvider<BuildProperties>` so the
controller boots even without `build-info.properties`. The `timestamp`
uses an injected `Clock` (a `@Bean` defined in `config/ClockConfig`),
which the third IT swaps for `Clock.fixed(...)` via a nested
`@TestConfiguration` so determinism is testable without touching
production code. Two infrastructure fixes surfaced during
implementation and were folded in: `TestcontainersConfiguration` was
promoted to `public` (otherwise ITs in sub-packages cannot `@Import` it)
and `maven-failsafe-plugin` was declared explicitly in `pom.xml`
(without it, the parent's `pluginManagement` does not activate and
`./mvnw verify` silently skips all `*IT` tests — the previous "green
baseline" had never executed an IT). `application.properties` was
converted to `application.yml` to match `docs/conventions.md`.

**Files touched:**

- `src/main/java/io/github/dariogguillen/chess/config/ClockConfig.java` (new)
- `src/main/java/io/github/dariogguillen/chess/web/health/HealthController.java` (new)
- `src/main/java/io/github/dariogguillen/chess/web/health/HealthResponse.java` (new)
- `src/test/java/io/github/dariogguillen/chess/web/health/HealthControllerIT.java` (new, 3 tests)
- `src/test/java/io/github/dariogguillen/chess/TestcontainersConfiguration.java` (modified: promoted to public)
- `src/main/resources/application.yml` (new), `application.properties` (deleted)
- `pom.xml` (modified: added `build-info` execution and explicit `maven-failsafe-plugin`)
- `README.md` (modified: documented `/api/health` under a new "API" section)
- `feature_list.json` (modified: `health-check.status` → `done`)

**Feature note:** `notes/01-health-check.md`.
